## üíª Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript

- Use `const` and `let` instead of `var`
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use semicolons consistently

```javascript
// Good
const gameWidth = 800;
const paddleHeight = 100;

function updateBallPosition() {
  ballX += ballSpeedX;
  ballY += ballSpeedY;
}

// Avoid
var w = 800;
var h = 100;

function doStuff() {
  // 50 lines of code
}
```

### CSS

- Use meaningful class names
- Group related properties
- Add comments for sections
- Maintain consistent indentation

```css
/* Good */
.paddle {
  position: absolute;
  width: 10px;
  height: 100px;
  background: white;
}

.paddle.left {
  left: 0;
}

/* Avoid */
.p {
  position: absolute; width: 10px; height: 100px; background: white;
}
```

### HTML

- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Maintain proper indentation
- Add alt text for images
- Use lowercase for tags and attributes
